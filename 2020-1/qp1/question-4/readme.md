# Testing PyOpenGL

## Prerequisites

This project is currently using `Python 3.8.3` and `pip 20.0.2`.

Clone this project and run the following commands in your terminal:

1. To setup a `Python` virtual environment:
    ```console
    $ python -m venv venv
    ```

2. Use the activate the `Python` virtual environment:
    ```console
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. To install the requirements:
    ```console
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Be aware of what is your `pip` version.

3. To give execute permissions to the `main.sh` file:
    ```console
    $ chmod u+x main.sh
    ```

## Usage

Once you have done the three steps shown above, run the following command in your terminal:

```console
$ ./main.sh
```
You will get an output as follows:

```bash
Rotated angle: 0rad
Rotated angle: 0.001rad
Rotated angle: 0.002rad
Rotated angle: 0.003rad
Rotated angle: 0.004rad
Rotated angle: 0.005rad
Rotated angle: 0.006rad
Rotated angle: 0.007rad
Rotated angle: 0.008rad
...
```

That will be reset until it reaches `PI/6` radians, and it will continue rotating for ever.

After finish the test you could make, please run the following command in your terminal:

```console
$ deactivate
```

This will deactivate the `Python` virtual environment, so you will be able to use your global environment as usual.
