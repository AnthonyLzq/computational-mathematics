# Graded practice 2 - Question 4

## Prerequisites

This project is currently using `Python 3.8.3` and `pip 20.0.2`.

Clone this project and run the following commands in your terminal:

1. To setup a `Python` virtual environment:
    ```console
    $ python -m venv venv
    ```

2. Use the activate the `Python` virtual environment:
    ```console
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. To install the requirements:
    ```console
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Be aware of what is your `pip` version.

3. To give execute permissions to the `main.sh` file:
    ```console
    $ chmod u+x main.sh
    ```

## Usage

Once you have done the three steps shown above, run the following command in your terminal:

```console
$ ./main.sh
```
You will get an output as follows:

```bash
Question 4

a. Lagrange interpolation
b. Beizer curve
c. B-Spline
d. Exit

Type an option:
```

So, you have to type an option, and a window may show up (sometimes it didn't happen, so check your dock, the window may be there) with the curve you have chosen.

After finish the test you could make, please run the following command in your terminal:

```console
$ deactivate
```

This will deactivate the `Python` virtual environment, so you will be able to use your global environment as usual.
